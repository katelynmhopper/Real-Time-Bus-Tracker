# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

## Description
This project tracks busses in Boston that run between MIT and Harvard. I changed the map style to be more navigation friendly.

## How to Run
To run this project you will need to create an account at https://account.mapbox.com/ to get your own unique access token. Once you have your token you will need to update the file to your token. The code for creating and moving the pacmen are in the index.html file where you can see the complete code. Try to come up with the solution on your own and then take the code and see what you can do with it.

##Roadmap of future improvements

In the future having all the actual stops on the map with a different icon would be helpful along wiht a way to hover over each to get the information for the stop.
