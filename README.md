# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

This project tracks busses in Boston that run between MIT and Harvard. I changed the map style to be more navigation friendly.
To run this project you will need to create an account at https://account.mapbox.com/ to get your own unique access token. Once you have your token you will need to update the file to your token.

In the future having all the actual stops on the map with a different icon would be helpful along wiht a way to hover over each to get the information for the stop.
